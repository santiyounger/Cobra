** Intro
   Hey this is my first logseq theme! It's heavily based around the color scheme of my [[https://github.com/santiyounger/Wasp-Obsidian-Theme][Obsidian Theme Wasp]] 

** Dark mode
   This theme was mainly made for Dark Mode.

** Light Mode
   However it does have a nice simple light mode too. It's not as complete as dark mode yet though

** How to set up
   If you are an advanced user you know what to do, git clone this repo and put it the ~custom.css~ in ~/logseq/custom.css~

   
*** Beginner friendly method
 If you consider yourself a beginner, this is how to do it.

**** Download
      Download this theme by pressing the green button called ~Code~ at the top right corner.

     1. Click on Download Zip

     2. Once it's in your downloads folder unzip it.

     3. All you'll need is the file called ~custom.css~ feel free to delete everything else /(the other files are for my own reference)/

     4. Move that ~custom.css~ file to your logseq notes in the folder called ~logseq~, there will already be another empty ~custom.css~ file there. Delete that one and replace it for mine.


  # *** Copy paste method
  #    Click here to open the file of the theme's code 
  #  [[file:custom.css]]
    
** How to update this theme
    I will keep updating this theme over time. So I recommend you repeat the download process every now and again for updates.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
In the future Logseq might provide a nice way to quickly update themes, but until then it's a very manual process.

** Credits
   Huge thanks to the Logseq theme for creating such an amazing piece of software. I truly think Logseq has the potential to be a perfect solution for many of us outline thinkers.
   
   Big shout out to [[https://github.com/cannibalox][cannibalox]] for his amazing theme [[https://github.com/cannibalox/logseq-dark-hpx][logseq-dark-hpx]] which I used as a template to create this one with his permission.
